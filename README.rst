``yeelight`` is a simple library that allows you to control YeeLight WiFi RGB
LED bulbs through your LAN.

This fork has ``discover_bulbs`` functionality removed in order to work with
Windows.


Installation
------------

There are many ways to install ``yeelight``:

* With pip (preferred), do ``pip install yeelight``.
* With setuptools, do ``easy_install yeelight``.
* To install from source, download it from
  https://gitlab.com/stavros/python-yeelight and do
  ``python setup.py install``.


Usage
-----

To use ``yeelight``, first enable "development mode" on your bulb through the YeeLight app.
Then, just import the library into your project like so::

    >>> from yeelight import Bulb

Afterwards, instantiate a bulb::

    >>> bulb = Bulb("192.168.0.5")
    >>> bulb.turn_on()

That's it!
